        const data = [{ "country": "India", "info": "The Taj Mahal, a jewel of Mughal architecture, was commissioned by the fifth Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan, as a mausoleum for his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Construction began in 1632, and the complex was completed in 1653. The chief architect is believed to have been Ustad Ahmad Lahori, and the design reflects a synthesis of Persian, Islamic, and Indian architectural styles. The Mughals, known for their grandeur, invested heavily in the arts, and the Taj Mahal is a prime example of their dedication to aesthetic refinement.Shah Jahan's decision to build the Taj Mahal was not only an expression of grief for Mumtaz Mahal's untimely death in 1631 but also a political move to establish a lasting legacy. The mausoleum, situated on the southern bank of the Yamuna River in Agra, incorporates symbolic elements, such as the use of the number eight, which holds cultural significance in Islamic art.The intricate marble inlay work, featuring semi-precious stones and exquisite calligraphy, is a defining characteristic of the Taj Mahal. The central dome, reaching a height of 73 meters (240 feet), is surrounded by four smaller domes and four minarets, creating a harmonious and balanced architectural composition.Following Shah Jahan's death in 1666, he was interred alongside Mumtaz Mahal in the Taj Mahal, completing the poignant narrative of eternal love. The Taj Mahal has endured as a symbol of architectural magnificence and has become a UNESCO World Heritage Site, drawing global admiration for its historical, cultural, and romantic significance." },

        { "country": "France", "info": "The French Revolution, a transformative period of political and social upheaval, culminated in the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte as a central figure in France's history. Emerging from the chaos of the Revolution, Napoleon seized power in 1799 through a coup d'état, establishing himself as First Consul and later, in 1804, as Emperor. His era, commonly referred to as the Napoleonic era, brought both continuity and change to revolutionary ideals. Napoleon codified laws in the Napoleonic Code, promoting equality before the law, but he also centralized power, creating a strong, authoritarian government. The Grand Empire he sought to establish encompassed vast territories in Europe, and his military campaigns, while achieving remarkable successes, ultimately led to his downfall. The Battle of Waterloo in 1815 marked the end of the Napoleonic era, as Napoleon was defeated and exiled, paving the way for the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy and reshaping the political landscape of post-revolutionary France and Europe.Napoleon Bonaparte's era, often known as the Napoleonic era, was marked by a combination of military conquests, administrative reforms, and a complex relationship with the revolutionary ideals of liberty and equality. Napoleon's military genius was evident in his series of victories, including the Battle of Austerlitz in 1805 and the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt in 1806. These triumphs expanded the French Empire across much of Europe.Internally, Napoleon implemented significant reforms through the Napoleonic Code, a legal system that aimed to consolidate and modernize French law. It promoted the principles of equality before the law, individual rights, and secularism. However, his rule also exhibited authoritarian tendencies, with censorship and restrictions on political freedoms.Napoleon's influence extended beyond legal and political spheres. He initiated educational reforms, established the Legion of Honor to recognize merit, and supported scientific and artistic endeavors through the creation of institutions like the Lycées and the Louvre Museum.The Peninsular War (1808-1814) and the invasion of Russia in 1812, however, marked turning points. The disastrous Russian campaign resulted in significant losses for the French forces, and the subsequent Sixth Coalition formed against Napoleon led to his defeat in the Battle of Leipzig in 1813.Exiled to the island of Elba, Napoleon escaped in 1815 and briefly returned to power during the Hundred Days. However, his final defeat occurred at the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815. This defeat led to his second exile, this time to the remote island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic, where he died in 1821. The Napoleonic era left a lasting impact on European history, influencing legal systems, nationalism, and the balance of power on the continent." },
        { "country": "Mongolia", "info": "The Mongol Empire, established by Genghis Khan in the early 13th century, stands as one of the largest contiguous land empires in history. Genghis Khan's unification of the Mongol tribes laid the foundation for a vast empire that, at its height, spanned from Eastern Europe to East Asia. Known for their formidable military tactics, including swift cavalry maneuvers and siege warfare expertise, the Mongols conducted successful campaigns across Eurasia. Genghis Khan's successors, such as Kublai Khan, extended the empire into China, founding the Yuan Dynasty, and influencing Chinese culture. The Mongol Empire facilitated cultural exchange and trade along the Silk Road, connecting East and West. While often associated with military conquests, the Mongols also contributed to governance and administration, implementing policies that allowed for religious tolerance and a degree of autonomy in conquered regions. Despite its eventual fragmentation into various khanates, the Mongol Empire left an enduring legacy on Eurasian history and the global exchange of ideas and commodities." }
